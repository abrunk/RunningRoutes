# RunningRoutes
I enjoy running. I started with the famous [Couch to 5k Plan](http://www.c25k.com/) more than 10 years ago, and gradually worked up to running two half marathons. I try to run every week, with most of my runs around 3-6m but occasionally going farther.

Beyond just focusing on distance, I often try to mix up my running routes to run past interesting places - through parks, past local landmarks, etc. I use apps like MapMyRun or Strava to build routes. But while those apps are great for finding good paths, they don't optimize your route.

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to use some R wizardry to build myself a basic running route application. 

The best place to review the application is in the published RMarkdown file [available here](Optimal-Running-Routes.md)
